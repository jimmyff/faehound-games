# Ultimate Quest

[Ultimate Quest](/ultimate-quest/) is a fantasy adventure and dungeon crawling game with old school vibes. This is a cooperative game for 1-6 players with a loose campaign system. The game creates unique stories and adventures filled with emergent narrative due to the vast combinations of content created by modular cards and dice rolls. Thanks to card driven content this game comes in a refreshingly small package whilst still offering epic adventures.

During Quests a map unfolds on the tabletop as the Champions explore in locations such as dungeons, castles and wild forests. Players will be rolling dice and manipulating the results using their Champion's Energy and Adrenaline. Characters and objects are represented by standees providing an element of rewarding tactical combat mixed in to the epic adventures.

# Deckorator

Deckorator is an open source tool ([available on Github](https://github.com/jimmyff/deckorator)) created by Jimmy for the purpose of building card based games. It's currently undergoing a rather major overhaul as I build Ultimate Quest. At some point I will do a pass over it and document areas in an attempt to get it ready for external use. Current features:

- Complex image manipulations such as masking
- DPI independent layout through a UI abstraction layer
- An app for easy development and rapid prototyping
- A cli tool for outputting components
- Image and PDF component output

## Project roadmap

Please bare in mind that this is a free open source side project and built when and as I have the time, driven by my own requirements. This means I can't give a timescale when/if the following features will be supported. I'd love help with the project so if you're interested in getting involved then please reach out to me on Github.

- Asset pipeline for cached asset generation
- Support CMYK colour profiles
- Support Spot Color profiles
- Reimplement multi-component page layouts
- Web UI/tool interface
- Output entire games in game engine friendly formats

# About Faehound Games

Hi, I'm Jimmy Forrester-Fellowes I'm the person behind Faehound Games. This name/emblem is as much a pledge as it a brand: any game bearing this mark will mean that you are getting something that I have given my absolute everything to. I create games as a labour of love rather an enterprise. If people enjoy playing something bearing the Faehound Games emblem then hopefully they will find their way to this website which can lead them to the newsletter, youtube account and provide information about other Faehound Games projects.

The name Faehound Games is inspired by love of fantasy and my gorgeous little Whippet Elphaba -with her suitably witchy name!
