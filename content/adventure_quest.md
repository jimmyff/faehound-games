## Who is this game for?

First and foremost this game is for people that love to adventure. It will likely appeal to fans of the old-school games that have inspired it's creation: Warhammer Quest, Dungeons & Dragons, Descent and Talisman.

The game is accessible enough that it can be played with players with little experience of the board gaming hobby. The champions are simple at the start and as they level up and discover more powerful equipment their options will expand but as will the players familiarity and knowledge of the game.

## A game of endless stories

Adventure Quest offers huge variability due to the vast combinations created by cards and dice rolls. The game will take you adventuring in different settings from castle dungeons, necromancers crypts to wild forests and beyond. Due to the modular nature of the content and the sheer number of combinations created by the cards and dice rolls no adventure will be the same. You may come across a kitchen room during two different Quests, but what/who you find there and what unfolds in that kitchen will almost certainly be vastly different.

There are times that your might come-across a combinations of abilities, items, enemies and events that could result in unpredictable situations. This game is not for the faint of heart. Unique situations will test your mettle and require you to prove your worth but hopefully leave you reminiscing about them for years to come.

## Create a unique champion

Character creation is similar to that of an RPG, you will choose their name, lineage and class. There are 6 distinctive champion classes that all offer unique gameplay mechanisms, their own character sheets and each also with a wealth of level-up paths. Different lineages offer further variability and fun combinations - how about a Centaur Witch, a Fairy Ranger or a Halfling-Ogre Druid? Unique and powerful legendary treasures, a variety of NPCs, companions and pets means no two Champions story's will ever be the same!

## Campaign / One-shots

This game offers a relaxed campaign/sandbox system: there is no linear path so no big plot to remember, the stories come from emergent narrative. This is more of a sandbox survival game allowing players freedom over where they go and what they will do. Each play session will take part in a campaign world but this doesn't have to be with the same party. It could be a one-shot session with vising friends or you could by trying some new champions. Despite the flexibility of this system there a start to the campaign and there is an end that can be attempted if the champions survive long enough to reach it...

Your champions progress is kept on a character sheet. Your champions are portable and could be dropped in and out of different campaign worlds and you can take them with you to a friends campaign or to a convention game (akin to old RPG character sheets that you might take to a one-shot adventure). You/your group might want a more traditional fixed party and that works great too. This is your world and these are your adventures, you decide the way you play!

## Solo play

This game has been designed with solo gaming in mind from the start. Thanks to the companion system you can run a balanced party without taking on the cognitive load of running more than one full champion (along with their character sheet and destiny dice). Companions offer a simplified game experience. This means you can run one full champion alongside any number of companions. As a result of this you aren't limited in what role you can play solo, you could go on adventuring as a Support Bard performing to your muse: a weathered half-ogre warrior companion!

## Big things come in small packages

There seems to be a trend of games becoming more bigger, heavier and more expensive and dungeon crawls can be some of the worst offenders. This game is in someways a reaction to that trend. A game that hopefully offers as big (if not bigger) adventure -in a more humble package. The game system is designed in a modular way and there will be space in the game box for future expansions to enrich your adventures and worlds with even more possibilities.
